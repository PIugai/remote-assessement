## FRONT END - 40 min
1. Create a github repository
2. Set up a frontend app with your favorite js framework & css library. 
3. Build a "click counter" in the middle of the page
Once the counter reaches 5, we are taken to another page.
On the second page, the same counter component is displayed 6 times using a grid positioning system
By clicking on a btn on the 2nd page, you can go back to the 1st page where the counter has maintained his former value due to a State Manager.
Create a mobile-first layout
Use inline & external css (pay attention to naming conventions)
Push the Front end application to the GitHub repository
